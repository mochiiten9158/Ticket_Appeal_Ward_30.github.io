                    <ul><li><p>You have seven (7) days from the date of issuance to contest a ticket. If nothing is received, you are then sent a Notice of Violation 
                        allowing you twenty-one (21) days to request a hearing. Still if no response is received, a Notice of Determination is sent notifying you that 
                        you have been found liable by default and must appear in person to petition to set the default aside. This option must be exercised within twenty-one 
                        (21) days of the date of the Determination. Once the twenty-one (21) days have lapsed, your opportunity to contest has expired.</p><p>For more

                    <ul><li><p>You may either select from one of the options below:</p></li></ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p style="font-size:16px;">Correspondence: When submitting a written correspondence hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will review your ticket, photographs 
                            and any other evidence that you submit. Once the ALJ completes their review and enters a decision, a hearing decision letter will be mailed to the 
                            address at which the vehicle is registered.</p></li>
                        <br><li><p style="font-size:16px;">In-Person: When submitting an in-person contest, you will receive correspondence in the mail letting you know when you can appear in-person 
                            to dispute the validity of the violation in front of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).</p></li>
                        <br><li><p style="font-size:16px;">Virtual: When submitting a virtual contest, you will receive correspondence in the mail and via email letting you know when you can appear 
                            virtually to dispute the validity of the violation with an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). All virtual hearings will be conducted via the Webex application. 
                            Please note, there are certain system requirements that you must verify prior to your scheduled virtual hearing. Evidence should be submitted when requesting 
                            your virtual hearing.</p></li>

                    <br><br><li><p style="color:rgb(175, 126, 66);">Do I have to pay additionally for contesting my ticket? And what are the chances that I will win?</p></li>
                    <ul><li><p>No, you do not need to pay for the appeal. In fact, if you win the appeal, you wouldn't have to pay at all! While the two most common violations in the 30th ward,
                         namely "Expired plates or temporary registration" and "No city sticker on a sub-16000 pound vehicle" incur the highest expenses, defending against the ticket is fairly simple -after
                         all- nearly 67.5% and 54% of the tickets are not liable after the proceedings!
